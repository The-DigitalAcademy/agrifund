                    <h1>About AgriFund</h1>
                    <p>In South Africa, there are approximately two million small-scale farmers compared to 35 000
                        commercial
                        growers. Small-scale farmers rely on their land to feed their families while selling and
                        trading
                        any
                        extra produce they have left.
                        <br>
                        If provided with the opportunity to acquire business funding, they will
                        be able to grow their farming activities to produce a greater crop yield that can be sold to
                        the
                        community. However, most small-scale farmers don’t have bookkeeping records which
                        automatically
                        disqualifies them from business funding.
                        <br>
                        AgriFund’s purpose is to create a platform that will allow
                        small-scale farmers to bookkeep data that can be used to build a financial portfolio needed
                        in
                        applying
                        for business funding.
