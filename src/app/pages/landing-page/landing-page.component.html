                <h1>About AgriFund</h1>
                <p>In South Africa, there are approximately two million small-scale farmers compared to 35 000
                    commercial
                    growers. Small-scale farmers rely on their land to feed their families while selling and trading any
                    extra produce they have left.
                    <br>
                    If provided with the opportunity to acquire business funding, they will
                    be able to grow their farming activities to produce a greater crop yield that can be sold to the
                    community. However, most small-scale farmers don’t have bookkeeping records which automatically
                    disqualifies them from business funding.
                    <br>
                    AgriFund’s purpose is to create a platform that will allow
                    small-scale farmers to bookkeep data that can be used to build a financial portfolio needed in
                    applying
                    for business funding.
