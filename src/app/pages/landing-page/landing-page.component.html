                                    In South Africa, there are approximately two
                                    million small-scale farmers compared to 35
                                    000 commercial growers. Small-scale farmers
                                    rely on their land to feed their families
                                    while selling and trading any extra produce
                                    they have left.

                                    If provided with the opportunity to acquire
                                    business funding, they will be able to grow
                                    their farming activities to produce a
                                    greater crop yield that can be sold to the
                                    community. However, most small-scale farmers
                                    don’t have bookkeeping records which
                                    automatically disqualifies them from
                                    business funding.

                                    AgriFund’s purpose is to create a platform
                                    that will allow small-scale farmers to
                                    bookkeep data that can be used to build a
                                    financial portfolio needed in applying for
                                    business funding.
